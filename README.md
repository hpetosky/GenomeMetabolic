Scripts used for the paper: "Mechanistic insights into plant community responses to environmental variables: genome size, cellular nutrient investments, and metabolic trade-offs"

"Hersch-Green-Hass_MetabolicCode.R" - Code for phylogenetic signal and PGLMM analyses (Li et al., 2020) for data on genome size, tissue and cellular nutrient contents, stomatal attributes, metabolic traits, lifeforms (grasses and forbs or just forbs), and site environmental variables of MAT and MAP. LM analyses for grasses, which did not have a significant phylogenetic signal for genome size, was done in another statistical software.
