Scripts used for the paper: "Mechanistic insights into plant community responses to environmental variables: genome size, cellular nutrient investments, and metabolic trade-offs"

"Data Processing and R Script.R" combines genome size data and metabolic traits for analyses. This data is analyzed in multiple ways; genome size is test for phylogenetic signal, and the data is examined for effect of genome size, lifeform, their interaction, and random effects of site and block nested within site on cellular nutrient content, and the effect of genome size, lifeform, their interaction, and random effects of site and block nested within site on stomata size and density.
