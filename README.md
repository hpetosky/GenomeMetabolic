"Hersch-Green-Hass_MetabolicCode.R" - Code for phylogenetic signal and PGLMM analyses (Li et al., 2020) for data on genome size, tissue and cellular nutrient contents, stomatal attributes, metabolic traits, lifeforms (grasses and forbs or just forbs), and site environmental variables of MAT and MAP. LM analyses for grasses, which did not have a significant phylogenetic signal for genome size, was done in another statistical software.
